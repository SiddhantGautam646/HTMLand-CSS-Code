        <p>The Internet is experiencing a dynamic and swift transformation, hurtling headlong into the promising realm of the "Internet of Things" (IoT). This future landscape envisages the interconnection of billions, if not trillions, of edge devices, poised to unleash torrents of data at unprecedented velocities. Some of the forthcoming applications within this IoT panorama will necessitate lightning-fast response times, demanding minimal latency. However, there will soon be a number of obstacles in the way of the traditional pillar of cloud infrastructure. Its centralization, which is characterized by a concentration of networking, storage, and computation resources in a small number of data centers, is its Achilles' heel.</p>
