        <p>The Internet is experiencing a dynamic and swift transformation, hurtling headlong into the promising realm of the "Internet of Things" (IoT). 
            This future landscape envisages the interconnection of billions,Some of the forthcoming applications within this IoT panorama will necessitate lightning-fast response times, demanding minimal latency. However, there will soon be a number of obstacles in the way of the traditional pillar of cloud infrastructure. Its centralization, which is characterized by a concentration of networking, storage, and computation resources in a small number of data centers, is its Achilles' heel. The significant physical distance between these distant data centers and the rapidly expanding edge device population further complicates matters. Further complicating matters is the considerable physical separation between these remote data centers and the burgeoning population of edge devices. In response to this formidable challenge, the emergence of edge cloud and edge computing stands as a beacon of hope.
             These innovative paradigms promise to proffer computational resources in close proximity to the resource-scarce edge IoT devices, The Internet's trajectory is marked by an inexorable march towards the impending future, a future that bears the hallmark of the "Internet of Things" (IoT). In this brave new world, we stand on the precipice of interconnecting not merely billions, but potentially a staggering multitude of devices, reaching into the realm of trillions. A prescient prediction put forth by Ericsson Inc. [1] casts a compelling narrative, 
             foretelling a pivotal juncture in 2025 when the global digital ecosystem will be graced by the convergence of over 50 billion </p>

           <p> if not trillions, of edge devices, poised to unleash torrents of data at unprecedented velocities.This optimistic outlook finds its roots in a confluence of cutting-edge technologies, with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) leading the charge. In this comprehensive survey paper, we embark on an exploratory journey, delving deep into the foundational principles underpinning this paradigm shift. Our mission encompasses a thorough examination of the current state-of-the-art efforts, the pivotal enabling technologies, and the pivotal research domains that hold the potential to redefine the IoT landscape. Our overarching objective is to craft a panoramic tapestry that captures the multifaceted facets of both ongoing research endeavors and the potential trajectories of future inquiry. Within this intricate tapestry, we shall unravel the intricate threads of thought, weaving together a comprehensive understanding of this evolving ecosystem. Additionally, 
            we aspire to shine a spotlight on the pivotal IoT applications that stand to reap rich rewards from the advent of the edge cloud.
            The bulk of these devices, intriguingly, will find their abode at the periphery of the Internet, akin to sentinels guarding the threshold. It is within this realm, at the Internet's edge, that the seeds of innovation shall bear fruit, ushering in a profound metamorphosis across the spectrum of traditional industrial operations and the tapestry of our quotidian existence. As the IoT takes its rightful place in our collective technological narrative, it promises to unfurl a transformative canvas, painting new applications that promise to reshape the very fabric of our world. Among the pioneering vanguards of this technological frontier,
             a cadre of visionary devices has already graced our lives, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of innovation.  </p>
