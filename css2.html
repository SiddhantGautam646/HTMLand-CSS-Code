            Edge computing is a computational paradigm that enables
edge servers in mini clouds (or edge clouds) to extend
cloud capabilities at the edge of the network to perform
computationally-intensive tasks and store a massive amount
of data at close proximity to user equipment (UEs) [1][3].
Traditional cloud computing, which is a centralized computing
paradigm that provides continuous access to highly
capable data centers, has been adopted to allow UEs to
ofoad computation and storage to the data centers [4]. This
is because UEs have limited processing, computational, and
storage capabilities. Nevertheless, edge computing is preferred
to cater for the wireless communication requirements
of next generation applications, such as augmented reality
and virtual reality, which are interactive in nature. These
highly interactive applications are computationally-intensive
and have high quality of service (QoS) requirements, including
low latency and high throughput (e.g, ultra reliable low
latency communication (URLLC), tactile internet) [5][7].
Most importantly, these applications are expected to generate
a massive amount of data up to 30.6 exabytes per month [8].
The limited capabilities of UEs warrants the need for edge
computing to: a) receive and store a massive amount of
real-time data, b) process, compute, and analyze the data,
